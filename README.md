This Project was programmed using Java for the purposes of the CSC 413 Term Project (Fall 2022). The intent was to create a 2D game that was both functional and intuitive to play. I believe this goal was achieved through a multifaceted approach involving object Oriented Analysis and Design principles accompanied by proper research and an eagerness to bring the game to fruition.

The main concept of the game I designed was heavily based on the Classic Super Mario Bros released by Nintendo in September of 1985. This game was and still is considered an icon of the times when computer graphics and software initially took their first steps outside of large corporations and into the hands of people with a passion for creation itself.

The development of Super Mario bros can be broken down into 5 main components: The Game Engine, Game Objects, Game Object Managers, I/O handlers, and the Game Map. Aside from the main components, we also have to manage the window in which the game is played, manage sound and animation, check collisions and notify the appropriate managers to identify and handle those collision, and lastly ensure we render all these components onto the screen in response to the multivariate interactions in the game.

It is important to note that all of these concepts implemented with the intention of following best coding practices for Object Oriented Software Design:

- **Cohesion** - Classes describe single entities, and all class operations fit together to support an object with a predefined purpose. Entities too large for a single class are broken down into smaller subcomponents â€“ each with their own responsibility.

- **Consistency** - The code structure (for the most part) follows the standard Java style and naming conventions: 
  - Descriptive names for classes, data fields, and methods
  - Class structure from top to bottom (imports, class header, data fields, constructors, and methods)
  - Proper use of access modifiers to grant or restrict access
  - Singletons for objects that require individuality (i.e. Game Engine)

- **Encapsulation** -  It is important to maintain a certain level of abstraction within the project. Objects are given data based on absolute necessity to reach full functionality. This makes code easier to debug and maintain.

- **Clarity** - Each class has a general contract at the beginning detailing its responsibility and implementation.

- **Inheritance & Aggregation** - Classes were designed using the is-a and has-a relationship. If the Object is-a variation of the parent object, we use inheritance. If the Object has-a relationship to the object we use aggregation. (i.e. Person:Student -> inheritance | Person:Dog -> aggregation)

**Super Mario Bros** is played on a 2D grid using the x-z axis (up, down, left, right). The goal of the game is to reach the flag and the right-most end of the map, all the while dipping, diving and dodging from Goomba, Koopa Troopa, and gaps in the ground. The user can hit bricks revealing prizes (Fire Flower, One-up mushroom, Magic mushroom) or coins. The main User Interface allows the user to select 3 different options(Start Game, Help, About). Once a map has been selected there is a User Interface in the top of the screen notifying you of your health status, points, coins, and time count.
